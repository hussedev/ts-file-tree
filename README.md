# ts-file-tree
A simple file browser in react

Usage:
- clone repo: ```git clone https://github.com/hussedev/ts-file-tree.git```
- install dependencies: ```npm install```
- run the server: ```npm start```

The client will listen on http://localhost:3000 by default, and will use a server API on http://localhost:3002 by default

I created a server for this browser, you can find it on this repo: https://github.com/hussedev/ts-file-server.git
